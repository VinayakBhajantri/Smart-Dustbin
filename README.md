# Smart-Dustbin


This project aims to revolutionize waste management in urban environments through the implementation of smart dustbins. These dustbins are equipped with IoT technology to monitor fill levels and automatically notify municipal authorities when they need to be emptied.

## Project Overview

The project aims to create a more efficient and hygienic waste disposal system by leveraging modern technology.


## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to address the critical issues of waste management and public health. By deploying smart sensors in dustbins, the project seeks to reduce waste overflow, enhance urban cleanliness, and promote environmental sustainability.

## Objectives

1. **Monitoring Waste Levels**: Use ultrasonic sensors to detect the fill level of dustbins and trigger alerts when they are nearly full.
2. **Automated Notifications**: Send notifications to municipal authorities for timely waste collection.
3. **Data Analysis**: Collect data for analysis to optimize waste collection routes and schedules.
4. **Public Awareness**: Raise awareness about proper waste disposal and recycling practices.

## System Implementation

The Smart Dustbin system comprises the following components:

### Hardware
- **ESP32 Dev Module**: The main controller used for data processing and communication.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures the fill level of the dustbin.
- **Servo Motor**: Controls the opening and closing of the dustbin lid.
- **GSM module**:  To send the SMS to replace the dustbin.
- **Power Supply**: Provides power to the components.

### Software
- **Firmware**: Written for the ESP32 to handle sensor data and control the servo motor.
- **Web and Cloud Services**: For data storage, monitoring, and analytics.

## Algorithm & Flowchart

1. **Sensor Data Collection**: The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to the waste surface.
2. **Data Processing**: The ESP32 processes the sensor data to determine the fill level.
3. **Notification**: If the fill level exceeds a certain threshold, a notification is sent to the authorities.
4. **Data Storage**: All data is stored for further analysis and optimization.

## Results & Discussion

The Smart Dustbin project has been tested and shown to effectively monitor waste levels, reduce overflow incidents, and provide valuable data for optimizing waste collection schedules.

## Sustainable Development Goals

This project contributes to several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including:

- **Goal 11**: Sustainable Cities and Communities
- **Goal 12**: Responsible Consumption and Production
- **Goal 13**: Climate Action

## Future Scope

Future enhancements could include integrating additional sensors for detecting different types of waste, further optimizing data analytics, and expanding the system to more urban areas.
